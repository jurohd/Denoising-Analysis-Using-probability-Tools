# Denoising-Analysis-Using-probability-Tools
Final project for Randomized Algorithm class
The purpose of this project will be to:
- understand the general framework of Chernoff-type bounds for sums of random matrices
- use an appropriate tail bound from this class of bounds to get guarantees on the performance of this denoiser
- provide an empirical evaluation of the performance of the denoiser

Here are the relevant reading materials (in order):
- Chapters 1 through 3 of Tropp's "An Introduction to Matrix Concentration Inequalities", available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571.pdf
- Chapter 2 and Chapter 6 up to section 6.5 of Wainwright's "High-Dimensional Statistics".
